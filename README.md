# RunawayBikes
**presented by Peter Cwalina, Rubin Peci, and Thomas Zhao

## Description:
We all live in the City of New York. After all, that's a requirement to even attend Stuyvesant High School. With all the global warming happening all around us, wouldn't it be nice if New York City could help curb carbon emissions? That is what CitiBikes are for: to provide an easy and green way to traverse the city! But one may ask, where are these stations for CitiBikes located? And what information may I glean from them? That is where RunawayBikes comes in.

RunawayBikes has a goal: to be able to showcase important information regarding CitiBikes in New York City. You will be able to see where these stations are on an interactive map, see how many available/unavailable bikes there are at each station, capacity, last reported status update from the station, etc. In the future, RunawayBikes will allow for additonal statistics reporting features regarding previous ride.s

### The data set(s) we will be using are:

- CitiBike stations
- CitiBike trips (reach for now)
